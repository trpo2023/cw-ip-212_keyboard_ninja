The air cleft by our flight beat in our faces, roared, whistled in our ears, tore at us, nipped us cruelly in its anger, tried to tear our heads off our shoulders. We had hardly strength to breathe from the pressure of the wind.It seemed as though the devil himself had caught us in his claws and was dragging us with a roar to hell.
